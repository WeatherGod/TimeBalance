An implementation of the Time Balance scheduling algorithm for adaptive sensing weather radars.
The implementation follows the description in Reinoso-Rondinel et al. (2010)

Requires NumPy (tested with NumPy 2.0, but earlier version should be usable).


Local installation is easy:

$ python setup.py install --user
